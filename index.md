Engage in fierce and engaging combat against colleges that feature individually processed projectiles to keep you on your toes!

![Game Over](/media/Game Over.gif)
<br/>
No punches (or in this case cannonballs) were pulled during the making of this game, and player death is implemented and possible!

![Tasks](/media/Tasks.gif)
<br/>
In addition to allowing inferior foes to join your ranks (complete with full image and palette swaps!), defeating colleges and other commendable tasks award you with well-earned loot!

<br/>
Once all the colleges are captured and you are as satisfied with the gameplay experience as you are with our code, return to your home college to win the game (and pick our code to win at life)!
