> ###### Give a systematic plan for the project. Your plan should lay out the key tasks, their starting and finishing dates, as well as task priorities and dependencies. Provide weekly snapshots of the plan on your team’s website and discuss how the plan evolved throughout the duration of the project (5 marks, ≤ 2 pages).

A way to implement this criteria needs to be provided here.
  * One way could be to post weekly screenshots of the trello?
  * Another could be to display gantt chart.
